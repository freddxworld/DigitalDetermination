# Life Update: A Rough Start to the Year

Man, this year has been **rough** so far. From moving into my first apartment with my girlfriend, to getting a new job and completely failing at it, to now **doing everything I can to break into IT**â€”itâ€™s been a rollercoaster.

## **The Job That Broke Me**

For context, this wasnâ€™t a tech job. It was a **physically demanding** job at a certain well-known place that handles **mail and packages**. You probably know the one. Letâ€™s just say their trucks are old, their routes are long, and their managementâ€¦ well, **letâ€™s talk about that**.

Iâ€™ve always prided myself on being **tough**â€”on pushing through no matter what. But this? **This was different.**

Iâ€™d start my shifts **early in the morning**, and by the time I got home, I barely had **two hours to do anything** before I had to get ready for the next shift. It was **nonstop**, and after a while, I realizedâ€”this wasnâ€™t sustainable.

## **Chaos, Disorganization, and Broken Promises**

From day one, the **supervisors were the worst**. One would say **one thing**, and another would say **something completely different**. The whole place was **a mess**â€”half the time, they were just **winging it**.

ðŸš© **No Vehicles Available** â€“ Iâ€™d show up for work and have to **wait around** because they didnâ€™t have a vehicle for me, losing valuable time before even starting my route.

ðŸš© **Unpredictable Schedule** â€“ My schedule said **2 PM every day**, but almost every morning, theyâ€™d text me:

- _"Come in at 9:30."_
- _"Come in at 8."_
- _"Actually, come in at 8:30."_

I never knew **when I was actually supposed to be there**.

ðŸš© **Broken Payroll System** â€“ They **messed up my first paycheck**, so I wasnâ€™t even paid on time.

ðŸš© **Terrible Equipment** â€“ The **vehicles were trash**â€”one literally **died on me mid-delivery**, and I had to wait **30 minutes** for someone to come help. **They still made me finish the route.**

## **The Day I Almost Broke**

We worked **six days a week**, and as a newcomer, I was supposed to get **one day off**â€”which I desperately needed. **8-10 hour days, sometimes even more.** By the time my day off came around, I was exhausted.

But as soon as I left the office, I got a **phone call** from one of the supervisors.

_"You have to come in tomorrow."_

I told him, **"Tomorrow is my day off."**

His response?  
_"That doesnâ€™t matter. The schedule changed. You have to come in."_

I checked the schedule **on the office wall**â€”it still showed my **day off**. **No one had told me anything.**

And the worst part?  
They waited until I **clocked out** to call me about it.

I asked what my shift would be. He said:  
_"10 AM to 8 PM. 10 hours."_

I was already **physically and mentally drained**. I told him I wasnâ€™t coming inâ€”I had proof it was **my day off**.

His response?  
_"If you donâ€™t show up, itâ€™ll be marked against you. Itâ€™ll go on your record. Youâ€™re still on probation."_

I hung up.

And then I **cried**.

Yeah, Iâ€™ll admit it. That was **the breaking point** for me.

I was **exhausted, burned out, and completely done.**

I messaged him back and told him:  
_"I wonâ€™t be coming in. Itâ€™s my day off, and Iâ€™m entitled to at least one."_

I fully expected consequences, but **guess what?**

**No one said anything to me the next day.**

I walked into work, expecting a supervisor to pull me asideâ€”but instead?  
One of them actually told me I was **doing a good job.**

At that moment, I realized something: **Management didnâ€™t care. They just pushed as hard as they could to see who would break.**

That was the moment the **thought of quitting** planted itself in my mind.

## **The Last Straw: The Day I Finally Quit**

On my **final day**, I had **just finished my route** and got back to the office at **5:30 PM**.

I was **so close** to clocking outâ€”literally about to put my **scanner away**â€”when a supervisor stopped me.

_"You need to go back out for another two-hour swing."_

No warning. **No prior notice.** They just **threw it on me.**

And the worst part? **It was already dark outside.**

They expected me to **go back out into unfamiliar areas, delivering mail in the dark, for another two hours.**

At that moment, I had two choices:

1. **Stay**â€”keep grinding, keep pushing, keep running myself into the ground.
2. **Walk away**â€”finally admit this job wasnâ€™t for me.

I went with my gutâ€”I quit. **Right then and there.**

And honestly? **It was the best decision I couldâ€™ve made.**

## **Lesson Learned**

Looking back, I realized something important:

ðŸ”¹ **If something is physically breaking you down, itâ€™s okay to stop.** I came home **drained every day**, not wanting to talk, not wanting to do anything. My body was telling me I couldn't keep this up forever.

ðŸ”¹ **Donâ€™t be afraid of failing at something new.** I was scared of **quitting too soon** since I had just started. But how long could I have gone before I got **injured or completely burned out?**

Some jobs just **arenâ€™t worth it**â€”and thatâ€™s okay. **Failing at something doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re weak.** Sometimes, failing is just **realizing something isnâ€™t right for you** and having the courage to walk away.

## **Moving Forward**

Now, Iâ€™m **fully focused** on breaking into IT. I know it wonâ€™t be easy, but Iâ€™d rather put my energy into **learning, growing, and building a future** than waste it on something that drains me.

This year started rough, but itâ€™s not over yet. Time to **push forward.**
