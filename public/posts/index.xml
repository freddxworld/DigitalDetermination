<p>Man, this year has been <strong>rough</strong> so far. From moving into my first apartment with my girlfriend, to getting a new job and completely failing at it, to now <strong>doing everything I can to break into IT</strong>â€”itâ€™s been a rollercoaster.</p>
<h2 id="the-job-that-broke-me"><strong>The Job That Broke Me</strong><a href="#the-job-that-broke-me" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"

<p>For context, this wasnâ€™t a tech job. It was a <strong>physically demanding</strong> job at a certain well-known place that handles <strong>mail and packages</strong>. You probably know the one. Letâ€™s just say their trucks are old, their routes are long, and their managementâ€¦ well, <strong>letâ€™s talk about that</strong>.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve always prided myself on being <strong>tough</strong>â€”on pushing through no matter what. But this? <strong>This was different.</strong></p>
<p>Iâ€™d start my shifts <strong>early in the morning</strong>, and by the time I got home, I barely had <strong>two hours to do anything</strong> before I had to get ready for the next shift. It was <strong>nonstop</strong>, and after a while, I realizedâ€”this wasnâ€™t sustainable.</p>

<p>From day one, the <strong>supervisors were the worst</strong>. One would say <strong>one thing</strong>, and another would say <strong>something completely different</strong>. The whole place was <strong>a mess</strong>â€”half the time, they were just <strong>winging it</strong>.</p>
<p>ðŸš© <strong>No Vehicles Available</strong> â€“ Iâ€™d show up for work and have to <strong>wait around</strong> because they didnâ€™t have a vehicle for me, losing valuable time before even starting my route.</p>
<p>ðŸš© <strong>Unpredictable Schedule</strong> â€“ My schedule said <strong>2 PM every day</strong>, but almost every morning, theyâ€™d text me:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;Come in at 9:30.&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Come in at 8.&rdquo;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Actually, come in at 8:30.&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I never knew <strong>when I was actually supposed to be there</strong>.</p>
<p>ðŸš© <strong>Broken Payroll System</strong> â€“ They <strong>messed up my first paycheck</strong>, so I wasnâ€™t even paid on time.</p>
<p>ðŸš© <strong>Terrible Equipment</strong> â€“ The <strong>vehicles were trash</strong>â€”one literally <strong>died on me mid-delivery</strong>, and I had to wait <strong>30 minutes</strong> for someone to come help. <strong>They still made me finish the route.</strong></p>

<p>We worked <strong>six days a week</strong>, and as a newcomer, I was supposed to get <strong>one day off</strong>â€”which I desperately needed. <strong>8-10 hour days, sometimes even more.</strong> By the time my day off came around, I was exhausted.</p>
<p>But as soon as I left the office, I got a <strong>phone call</strong> from one of the supervisors.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;You have to come in tomorrow.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I told him, <strong>&ldquo;Tomorrow is my day off.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>His response?<br>
<em>&ldquo;That doesnâ€™t matter. The schedule changed. You have to come in.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I checked the schedule <strong>on the office wall</strong>â€”it still showed my <strong>day off</strong>. <strong>No one had told me anything.</strong></p>
<p>And the worst part?<br>
They waited until I <strong>clocked out</strong> to call me about it.</p>
<p>I asked what my shift would be. He said:<br>
<em>&ldquo;10 AM to 8 PM. 10 hours.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I was already <strong>physically and mentally drained</strong>. I told him I wasnâ€™t coming inâ€”I had proof it was <strong>my day off</strong>.</p>
<p>His response?<br>
<em>&ldquo;If you donâ€™t show up, itâ€™ll be marked against you. Itâ€™ll go on your record. Youâ€™re still on probation.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I hung up.</p>
<p>And then I <strong>cried</strong>.</p>
<p>Yeah, Iâ€™ll admit it. That was <strong>the breaking point</strong> for me.</p>
<p>I was <strong>exhausted, burned out, and completely done.</strong></p>
<p>I messaged him back and told him:<br>
<em>&ldquo;I wonâ€™t be coming in. Itâ€™s my day off, and Iâ€™m entitled to at least one.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I fully expected consequences, but <strong>guess what?</strong></p>
<p><strong>No one said anything to me the next day.</strong></p>
<p>I walked into work, expecting a supervisor to pull me asideâ€”but instead?<br>
One of them actually told me I was <strong>doing a good job.</strong></p>
<p>At that moment, I realized something: <strong>Management didnâ€™t care. They just pushed as hard as they could to see who would break.</strong></p>
<p>That was the moment the <strong>thought of quitting</strong> planted itself in my mind.</p>

<p>On my <strong>final day</strong>, I had <strong>just finished my route</strong> and got back to the office at <strong>5:30 PM</strong>.</p>
<p>I was <strong>so close</strong> to clocking outâ€”literally about to put my <strong>scanner away</strong>â€”when a supervisor stopped me.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;You need to go back out for another two-hour swing.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>No warning. <strong>No prior notice.</strong> They just <strong>threw it on me.</strong></p>
<p>And the worst part? <strong>It was already dark outside.</strong></p>
<p>They expected me to <strong>go back out into unfamiliar areas, delivering mail in the dark, for another two hours.</strong></p>
<p>At that moment, I had two choices:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stay</strong>â€”keep grinding, keep pushing, keep running myself into the ground.</li>
<li><strong>Walk away</strong>â€”finally admit this job wasnâ€™t for me.</li>
</ol>
<p>I went with my gutâ€”I quit. <strong>Right then and there.</strong></p>
<p>And honestly? <strong>It was the best decision I couldâ€™ve made.</strong></p>
<h2 id="lesson-learned"><strong>Lesson Learned</strong><a href="#lesson-learned" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"

      <line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line>
   </svg></a></h2>
<p>Looking back, I realized something important:</p>
<p>ðŸ”¹ <strong>If something is physically breaking you down, itâ€™s okay to stop.</strong> I came home <strong>drained every day</strong>, not wanting to talk, not wanting to do anything. My body was telling me I couldn&rsquo;t keep this up forever.</p>
<p>ðŸ”¹ <strong>Donâ€™t be afraid of failing at something new.</strong> I was scared of <strong>quitting too soon</strong> since I had just started. But how long could I have gone before I got <strong>injured or completely burned out?</strong></p>
<p>Some jobs just <strong>arenâ€™t worth it</strong>â€”and thatâ€™s okay. <strong>Failing at something doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re weak.</strong> Sometimes, failing is just <strong>realizing something isnâ€™t right for you</strong> and having the courage to walk away.</p>

      <line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line>
   </svg></a></h2>
<p>Now, Iâ€™m <strong>fully focused</strong> on breaking into IT. I know it wonâ€™t be easy, but Iâ€™d rather put my energy into <strong>learning, growing, and building a future</strong> than waste it on something that drains me.</p>
<p>This year started rough, but itâ€™s not over yet. Time to <strong>push forward.</strong></p>

<p>Over the years, Iâ€™ve explored various aspects of techâ€”from <strong>front-end development</strong> to <strong>Linux tinkering, home labs, and cybersecurity</strong>. As I continue learning and shifting toward IT and security, I realized I wanted a place to document my experiences, struggles, and wins.</p>
<p>This blog is my way of keeping track of what I learn, sharing <strong>IT projects</strong>, and discussing the balance between <strong>tech, work, and personal life</strong>.</p>
