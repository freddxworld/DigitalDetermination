From moving into my first apartment with my girlfriend, to getting a new job and completely failing at it, to now doing everything I can to break into IT—it’s been a rollercoaster.\nThe Job That Broke Me For context, this wasn’t a tech job. It was a physically demanding job at a certain well-known place that handles mail and packages. You probably know the one. Let’s just say their trucks are old, their routes are long, and their management… well, let’s talk about that.\nI’ve always prided myself on being tough—on pushing through no matter what. But this? This was different.\nI’d start my shifts early in the morning, and by the time I got home, I barely had two hours to do anything before I had to get ready for the next shift. It was nonstop, and after a while, I realized—this wasn’t sustainable.\nChaos, Disorganization, and Broken Promises From day one, the supervisors were the worst. One would say one thing, and another would say something completely different. The whole place was a mess—half the time, they were just winging it.\n🚩 No Vehicles Available – I’d show up for work and have to wait around because they didn’t have a vehicle for me, losing valuable time before even starting my route.\n🚩 Unpredictable Schedule – My schedule said 2 PM every day, but almost every morning, they’d text me:\n“Come in at 9:30.” “Come in at 8.” “Actually, come in at 8:30.” I never knew when I was actually supposed to be there.\n🚩 Broken Payroll System – They messed up my first paycheck, so I wasn’t even paid on time.\n🚩 Terrible Equipment – The vehicles were trash—one literally died on me mid-delivery, and I had to wait 30 minutes for someone to come help. They still made me finish the route.\nThe Day I Almost Broke We worked six days a week, and as a newcomer, I was supposed to get one day off—which I desperately needed. 8-10 hour days, sometimes even more. By the time my day off came around, I was exhausted.\nBut as soon as I left the office, I got a phone call from one of the supervisors.\n“You have to come in tomorrow.”\nI told him, “Tomorrow is my day off.”\nHis response?\n“That doesn’t matter. The schedule changed. You have to come in.”\nI checked the schedule on the office wall—it still showed my day off. No one had told me anything.\nAnd the worst part?\nThey waited until I clocked out to call me about it.\nI asked what my shift would be. He said:\n“10 AM to 8 PM. 10 hours.”\nI was already physically and mentally drained. I told him I wasn’t coming in—I had proof it was my day off.\nHis response?\n“If you don’t show up, it’ll be marked against you. It’ll go on your record. You’re still on probation.”\nI hung up.\nAnd then I cried.\nYeah, I’ll admit it. That was the breaking point for me.\nI was exhausted, burned out, and completely done.\nI messaged him back and told him:\n“I won’t be coming in. It’s my day off, and I’m entitled to at least one.”\nI fully expected consequences, but guess what?\nNo one said anything to me the next day.\nI walked into work, expecting a supervisor to pull me aside—but instead?\nOne of them actually told me I was doing a good job.\nAt that moment, I realized something: Management didn’t care. They just pushed as hard as they could to see who would break.\nThat was the moment the thought of quitting planted itself in my mind.\nThe Last Straw: The Day I Finally Quit On my final day, I had just finished my route and got back to the office at 5:30 PM.\nI was so close to clocking out—literally about to put my scanner away—when a supervisor stopped me.\n“You need to go back out for another two-hour swing.”\nNo warning. No prior notice. They just threw it on me.\nAnd the worst part? It was already dark outside.\nThey expected me to go back out into unfamiliar areas, delivering mail in the dark, for another two hours.\nAt that moment, I had two choices:\nStay—keep grinding, keep pushing, keep running myself into the ground. Walk away—finally admit this job wasn’t for me. I went with my gut—I quit. Right then and there.\nAnd honestly? It was the best decision I could’ve made.\nLesson Learned Looking back, I realized something important:\n🔹 If something is physically breaking you down, it’s okay to stop. I came home drained every day, not wanting to talk, not wanting to do anything. My body was telling me I couldn’t keep this up forever.\n🔹 Don’t be afraid of failing at something new. I was scared of quitting too soon since I had just started. But how long could I have gone before I got injured or completely burned out?\nSome jobs just aren’t worth it—and that’s okay. Failing at something doesn’t mean you’re weak. Sometimes, failing is just realizing something isn’t right for you and having the courage to walk away.\nMoving Forward Now, I’m fully focused on breaking into IT. I know it won’t be easy, but I’d rather put my energy into learning, growing, and building a future than waste it on something that drains me.\nThis year started rough, but it’s not over yet. Time to push forward.\nAlfredo ",
